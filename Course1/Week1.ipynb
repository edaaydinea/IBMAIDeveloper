    "    - Goal: To discuss software versions on computing platforms and identify software versions and numbering.\n",
    "2. **Importance of Software Versions**:\n",
    "    - Version numbers provide information about programs and applications.\n",
    "    - Help users determine the version they are using.\n",
    "    - Enable developers to convey useful information through version numbers.\n",
    "3. **Structure of Version Numbers**:\n",
    "    - Version numbers vary in length and meaning but generally follow a similar format.\n",
    "    - Indicate release dates, updates, and minor changes or patches.\n",
    "    - Version numbers can be displayed in several ways, typically with 2, 3, or 4 number sets divided by periods.\n",

    "        - First release: 1.0 (indicating no updates or fixes).\n",
    "        - Beta version: 0.9 (indicating a version still in testing).\n",
    "4. **Semantic Versioning**:\n",
    "    - A common versioning system that uses 4 parts separated by periods:\n",
    "        1. **Major Version**: Indicates major changes or new releases.\n",
    "            1. version 9\n",
    "        2. **Minor Version**: Indicates minor changes or updates.\n",
    "            1. version 9.1\n",
    "        3. **Patch Number**: Indicates patches or minor bug fixes.\n",
    "            1. version 9.1.33\n",
    "        4. **Build Number/Date**: Indicates less significant changes or the build date.\n",
    "            1. version 9.1.33.6\n",
    "5. **Date-Based Versioning**:\n",
    "    - Some developers use dates for versioning.\n",
    "    - Example: Ubuntu Linux version 18.04.2:\n",
    "        - Released in April 2018.\n",
    "        - The third number (2) designates an additional update or change.\n",
    "6. **Locating Software Version Numbers**:\n",
    "    - Version numbers are often found in the \"About\" or \"Help\" section of software.\n",
    "    - Example (Google Chrome):\n",
    "        1. Select the three dots/lines in the top-right corner.\n",
    "        2. Select “Help”.\n",
    "        3. Select “About” to view version information.\n",
    "    - This method can be applied to other web browsers similarly.\n",
    "7. **Compatibility Issues**:\n",
    "    - Compatibility between old and new software versions is a common issue.\n",
    "    - Updating to newer versions can resolve compatibility issues.\n",
    "    - Some software is backwards compatible, allowing older versions to work with newer versions.\n",
    "8. **Conclusion**:\n",
    "    - Version numbers track changes, updates, and patches in software.\n",
    "    - Semantic numbering system with 4 parts is common but not universal.\n",
    "    - Viewing the version number helps determine compatibility and troubleshoot issues.\n",
