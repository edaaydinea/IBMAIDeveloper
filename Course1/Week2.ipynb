    "### **Advantages and Disadvantages of Specific Stacks**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **MEAN Stack**:\n",
    "    - **Advantages**:\n",
    "        - Uses JavaScript throughout, simplifying development.\n",
    "        - Open source with a large collection of reusable modules.\n",
    "        - Fast development due to Node.js.\n",
    "    - **Disadvantages**:\n",
    "        - Not ideal for large-scale applications.\n",
    "        - MongoDB may not provide the same functionality as relational databases.\n",
    "2. **MEVN Stack**:\n",
    "    - **Advantages**:\n",
    "        - Similar to MEAN but uses Vue.js, which can be more performant.\n",
    "        - Open source with reusable components.\n",
    "    - **Disadvantages**:\n",
    "        - Vue.js is newer and may not have as many libraries as Angular.js.\n",
    "3. **LAMP Stack**:\n",
    "    - **Advantages**:\n",
    "        - Open source with a long history and extensive support.\n",
    "        - Well-suited for relational data.\n",
    "    - **Disadvantages**:\n",
    "        - Less flexible due to the integration of Linux.\n",
    "        - Uses different languages for front-end and back-end development, which can complicate the development process compared to MEAN/MEVN stacks.\n"
