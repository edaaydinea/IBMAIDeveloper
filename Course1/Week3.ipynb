    "\n",
    "1. **Branching Logic:**\n",
    "    - **Definition:** Involves making decisions in a program to determine which set of instructions to execute based on certain conditions.\n",
    "    - **How it Works:** The program chooses between different branches of code depending on the outcome of Boolean expressions.\n",
    "    - **Key Constructs:**\n",
    "        - **If Statement:** Executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.\n",
    "        - **If-Then-Else:** Executes one block of code if a condition is true and another if the condition is false.\n",
    "        - **Switch Statement:** Chooses between multiple branches of code based on the value of a variable or expression.\n",
    "        - **GoTo:** Jumps to another line of code, often used to exit from deep within a code block.\n",
    "2. **Looping Logic:**\n",
    "    - **Definition:** Involves repeating a sequence of instructions until a specific condition is met.\n",
    "    - **How it Works:** Continually executes a block of code as long as a condition is true.\n",
    "    - **Key Constructs:**\n",
    "        - **While Loop:** Repeats a block of code as long as the condition is true. The condition is checked before executing the loop body.\n",
    "        - **For Loop:** Iterates a specific number of times, typically using a counter variable.\n",
    "        - **Do-While Loop:** Similar to a while loop, but the condition is evaluated after the loop body has been executed, ensuring the loop runs at least once.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Boolean Expressions and Variables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Boolean Expression:** A statement that evaluates to either true or false, used in both branching and looping to control the flow of the program.\n",

    "**Identifiers:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition:** Identifiers are custom-named labels used by software developers to reference various components in a program, such as stored values, methods, interfaces, or classes.\n",
    "- **Types of Data Identifiers Store:**\n",
    "    - **Constant:** A data item with a fixed value that does not change during the program's execution. Examples include mathematical constants like Pi or text strings like a player's name.\n",
    "    - **Variable:** A data item whose value can change during the program's execution. Variables can hold strings of text, numerical values, or other types of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits of Using Constants:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ease of Readability:** Constants make code more readable by providing meaningful names instead of hard-coded values.\n",
    "2. **Ease of Maintenance:** If a constant's value needs to change, it can be updated in one place rather than searching and replacing all occurrences in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Characteristics:** Unlike constants, variables are used to store data that can change during the execution of a program. They are useful for storing unknown or user-input data such as usernames, ages, or scores.\n",
    "- **Declaration and Initialization:** Variables can be declared with a specific data type and an initial value. Alternatively, they can be declared without an initial value, which can be assigned later during the program's execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Containers:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Containers are special identifiers that can reference multiple elements in a program, making it more efficient to manage large amounts of data without creating individual variables for each element.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of Containers:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Arrays:**\n",
    "    - **Definition:** Arrays are collections of a fixed number of elements of the same type stored in sequential order, starting from index zero.\n",
    "    - **Characteristics:** Arrays have a fixed size specified at the time of declaration. The data type of the array elements is also specified.\n",
    "    - **Syntax Example:** `int myArray[10];` declares an array of integers with a maximum of 10 elements.\n",
    "2. **Vectors:**\n",
    "    - **Definition:** Vectors, also known as dynamic arrays, can automatically resize themselves as elements are added or removed.\n",
    "    - **Characteristics:** Unlike arrays, vectors do not have a fixed size and can grow or shrink dynamically. However, this flexibility comes at the cost of more memory usage and slightly slower access times compared to arrays.\n",
    "    - **Syntax Example:** `vector<int> myVector;` declares a vector that can store an unspecified number of integer elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identifiers are essential in programming for referencing program components. They can be constants or variables, depending on whether the data they store is immutable or mutable.\n",

    "    - **States (Properties):** Attributes that define the object's characteristics, stored in fields (or variables).\n",
    "    - **Behaviors (Methods):** Actions the object can perform, implemented as procedures or functions.\n",
    "- **Software Objects:** Can represent a wide range of entities, such as a Windows service, a user account, a database table, or a system folder.\n",

    "- **Functions** are modular, reusable pieces of code designed to perform specific actions. They help in breaking down complex programs and can be either standard library functions or user-defined.\n",
