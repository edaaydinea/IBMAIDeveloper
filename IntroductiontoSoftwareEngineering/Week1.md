    - Evolved to include more iterative methods to address customer needs and changing requirements.
- **Advantages of the SDLC**:
    - Provides a structured process, improving efficiency and reducing risks.
    - Discrete, well-defined phases guide team members on their tasks and timelines.
    - Facilitates communication between customers, stakeholders, and development teams.
    - Offers an overview of the process, helping stakeholders understand their roles.
    - Enables cross-domain teams to know when their tasks are completed and when to move to the next phase.
    - Allows for iteration to incorporate additional requirements as needed.
    - Addresses problems early in the cycle, ideally in the design phase rather than during coding.
    - Clearly defines team member roles, reducing conflict and overlapping responsibilities.

## Phases of the SDLC

- **Introduction to the Phases of the SDLC**:
    - The SDLC generally involves six phases: planning, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
    - Each phase is discrete, with tasks from previous phases not overlapping with the next.
    - The SDLC began with the traditional waterfall method but has adapted to iterative methods for shifting requirements.
    - Organizations may use different names for each stage and may have additional or fewer stages.
- **Planning Phase**:
    - Requirements are gathered, analyzed, documented, and prioritized.
    - Factors to consider: users, purpose, data inputs and outputs, legal and regulatory compliance, risk identification, quality assurance, resource allocation, and project scheduling.
    - Labor and material costs are estimated, and project teams are identified with proposed roles.
    - Prototyping may be used to clarify requirements.
    - The result is a software requirements specification (SRS) document, understood and approved by all stakeholders.
- **Design Phase**:
    - Uses requirements from the SRS to develop software architecture.
    - Team collaboration to design architecture, reviewed by stakeholders.
    - Prototypes may be designed for demonstration purposes.
    - A design document is created for developers to use in the next phase.
- **Development Phase**:
    - Also called the "building" or "implementation" phase.
    - Developers start coding based on the design document.
    - Project planners determine and assign coding tasks.
    - Use of programming tools, languages, and software stacks, adhering to organizational standards and guidelines.
- **Testing Phase**:
    - Follows the completion of coding.
    - Dedicated testing teams may be involved.
    - Ensures code is stable, secure, and meets SRS requirements.
    - Testing can be manual, automated, or hybrid.
    - Bugs are reported, tracked, fixed, and code is retested.
    - Common levels: unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.
- **Deployment Phase**:
    - Application is released into the production environment.
    - May be staged, starting with user acceptance testing (UAT) before full production release.
    - Applicable for website, mobile app store, or corporate network distribution.
